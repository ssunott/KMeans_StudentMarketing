# Student Clustering Project

This repository contains an unsupervised clustering pipeline that groups students based on demographic information and interests. We use the K‚ÄëMeans algorithm, along with methods like the elbow plot and silhouette score, to determine the optimal number of clusters.

This app has been built using Streamlit and deployed with Streamlit community cloud

## Dataset

* Data sourced from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zabihullah18/students-social-network-profile-clustering 

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Preprocessing Steps

1. **Drop empty records** where both `age` and `gradyear` are missing.
2. **Clean `age`** by removing text suffixes (e.g. "19.Mar") and filling missing ages with median per `gradyear`.
3. **Filter out outliers** in `age` outside the 1st‚Äì99th percentile.
4. **Encode `gender`** as one-hot dummy variables.

## üìä Clustering Method

* **Algorithm**: K‚ÄëMeans
* **Selecting *k***:

  * **Elbow method**: Plot inertia vs. *k* and look for the point of diminishing returns.
  * **Silhouette score**: Compute average silhouette for *k* = 2‚Ä¶10 and choose the highest.

---

## üìà Visualization

* **Elbow plot**: `plot_elbow_score()` generates and saves `{project_root}/elbow_plot.png`.
* **Silhouette plot**: `plot_silhouette_score()` shows silhouette score vs. *k*.

## Technologies Used
- **Streamlit**: For building the web application.
- **Scikit-learn**: For model training and evaluation.
- **Pandas** and **NumPy**: For data preprocessing and manipulation.
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**: For exploratory data analysis and visualization (if applicable).

## Installation (for local deployment)
If you want to run the application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ssunott/KMeans_StudentMarketing.git
   cd credit_eligibility_application

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `env\\Scripts\\activate`

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Run the Streamlit application:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
